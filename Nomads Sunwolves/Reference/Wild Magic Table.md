| 29–32 | The next time you cast a spell that deals [damage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Rules%20Definitions?expansion=32231#Damage) within the next minute, don’t roll the spell’s damage dice for the [damage](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Rules:Rules%20Definitions?expansion=32231#Damage).
