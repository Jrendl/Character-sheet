Theodeger was born to loving, human, parents Solomon and Victoria in a small town named Selden in the north of the Republic. It was immediately obvious upon his birth that there was something wrong with Theodeger, for his eyes were red and there were small, almost horn-like, nubbins on his temples. Solomon and Victoria knew that Theodeger was going to prove a challenge to raise, but they loved him nonetheless. 

  

As expected, the problems began only days after Theo’s birth. As most parents are aware, those first nights with a child are restless, stressful times. The baby cries and barfs and poops as it adjusts and learns how to be, well, human. Now this all happened with Theo too, but one night, a few days after his birth, his crying, though normally loud for a child, seemed to shake the nursery. The new parents brushed this off originally, but it eventually became a nightly occurrence that the child’s howls would shake the house, causing glass to shatter and vases to fall. Unable to think of another solution, the parents took poor Theo to the wizard that lived a few hours out of their town, who diagnosed that Theo was, in fact, a Tiefling who seemed to have been imbued with the power of chaos. As all knew, Tieflings were meant to come from cursed bloodlines. But Solomon and Victoria were among the respected folk in their town and had no sinful ancestry. The wizard suggested that one of them must’ve made a deal with a hag, or bargained with one of The Nine…. But, of course, they both denied these accusations. Without being able to get to root cause of the state of their child, the wizard suggested that they should use incense to weaken the effects of these waves of chaos, and that once the child was old enough to learn, he should train with the wizard to control the chaos and learn to meditate. 

  

Eventually, the turbulence lessened. The child’s onslaughts of chaos went from nightly, to weekly, and eventually monthly. Once Theo hit the age of 1, he began his training with the wizard, Faymora, who taught Theo to suppress his chaos and hide it deep within through meditation and control. The frequency of the outburst began decreasing at a faster rate. Until becoming more of a yearly occurrence. 

  

At the age of 6, Theo began primary school, his parents biggest concern. And their concerns were justified. As Theo was subjected to bullying and name calling by his classmates, most of whom were scared of his horns (now a few inches in length) and his red eyes. The worst of all bullies was Peter, who made it his personal mission to make Theo’s life a living hell. Faymora’s training had paid off in suppressing more than just the chaos though, Theo learned to hide his emotions, from Peter and his parents. 

  

It had been almost two years since Theo’s last outburst as he started his second school season at 7 years old. But holding down all that chaos, and all those emotions, for that long is a dangerous thing. It only took a week for one fateful day where Peter followed Theo on his walk home from school, taunting him the whole way. When Theo finally got home, he wasn’t greeted by his parents but other members of Peter’s gang blocking his way into his home. They began beating and kicking Theo while calling him names raising various insults. Eventually, Theo broke, he began shouting back, his voice slowly rising above human levels, and his eyes beginning to glow along with his anger. All this ruckus drew his parents out from the safety of their home, where they rushed to attempt to calm Theo down before the inevitable happened. Afraid for their lives, the other children began to flee, which only angered Theo further. He slowly began to levitate, his voice still growing in volume and now intermingled with other wispy and creepy voices until his parents could only hold onto him by the tips of his fingers. And then, Theo exploded. A giant force of chaos, and anger, and hurt, that had been pent up for years, killing his parents and leveling the nearby houses. Theo blacked out.

  

When he finally came to, Theo saw his parents bodies beneath him, Peter and his parents standing with most of the rest of the village, and Faymora looming over him, her face struck with fear and sadness, but little concern. Struck with grief and fear himself, Theo got up and he ran, and he didn’t stop running, for a long, long, time. 

  

Three years passed, and Theo was living as a nomad in the Heartlands just north of The Republic. Although he still feared his powers, Theo had found some use in the magic possessing him. It allowed him to make fire when he was cold, or silently convince animals to lay down and give themselves up for food. He still hadn’t had another explosion, but was weary of it daily. He attempted to keep up the practices that Faymora had taught him, but wasn’t very good at it without instruction. 

  

He rarely came across towns, and when he did he was usually chased out with pitchforks, torches, and rifles. It was one of these occasions that Theo once again lost his cool. He had entered a town named Far Rest to pick the market of fruit and bread when he saw a familiar face at one of the market stalls, Peter. Carefully avoiding Peter's gaze, Theo snuck along the market street towards a stand a few down from Peter’s. While performing his usual sleight of hand, theo slipped up and dropped an apple that he had pocketed. In reaching for the apple, his hood fell and Peter saw his face. Theo grabbed the apple and ran, Peter in pursuit. Weaving in and out of stands, climbing buildings, jumping gaps, attempting to evade his childhood nemesis. Eventually, Theo found himself in a dead end, turned around and saw Peter approaching. Afraid for his life, Theo let out a blood curdling scream and let out the chaos that had been building inside him for three years. In an instant, a blast as strong as the atomic bomb centered on Theo expanded, leveling the entire town and killing everyone in sight. 

  

When he awoke, Theo couldn’t believe what had happened. He stumbled out of the town and wept the whole way. He could not comprehend the destruction he had caused. He spent a few hours wandering the streets of the town, looking at the bodies of the dead, letting it sink in. He then walked to a nearby lake, one that he had spent some time at, and sat by its side. Wondering why he was put into this world. Why was he made this way? His parents gone, and burdened by the guilt of destruction, he stood up and walked into the lake. 

  

Theo sat at the bottom of the lake until he could no longer breathe and the darkness started closing in around him. At the moment his heart stopped, he had a vision. Out of darkness burst a ray of dazzling light and color, and out of that ray walked Lycus. And Lycus spoke to Theodeger: “You are not done yet! Your place in this world has yet to be fulfilled. I made a deal with your mother, and you were meant for greater things than this! I will not let you give up so easily. Your gifts are a blessing, not a curse, you must learn to use them, not suppress them. Only then will you be able to fulfill your destiny. Travel to the Northern Freelands, where you will find Veil of Shadows, a Tabaxi sorcerer also blessed with the powers of chaos. He will teach you how to use your powers.”

  

Theo woke on the beach next to the lake, he bolted upright and stared into it’s depths. Was that real? Even if it wasn’t, he now had a purpose. He was to travel to the Freelands and train with this so-called “Veil” so that he could learn to control his power for good.

  

He spent three years training with Veil, until he was deemed ready to go off again on his own and work as a mercenary serving the Katerook Empire. Now was his chance to do good in the world. He wasn’t about to waste it.
